This `embeddings` directory contains source codes and figures relating to two different embedding-generation methods that we tried -- [GraphSAGE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02216.pdf), [Node2Vec](https://snap.stanford.edu/node2vec/) and [AttentionWalk](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/8131-watch-your-step-learning-node-embeddings-via-graph-attention). 

Some minor changes will be needed to be made in the code for generating embeddings for independent STRING or BioPlex data (like file path, column name etc).
